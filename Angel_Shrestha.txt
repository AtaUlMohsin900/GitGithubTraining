Hi, This is Angel Shrestha.
I did this GitGithub Training from GCA platform.
What I learnt from this training:
-I had previously used Github so as to keep my project safe. But I didn't know that Git and Github were different.
-The first thing that I learnt is Git and Github are different and the git as version control system.
-I learnt Github is not needed to keep my file safe, I can only use git to track my logs and other different repository for remote work
-As a programmer, this training has surely build up my confidence.
-Thank you for the program and availability of all these resources for learners like me.
-A huge gratitude to Milan Thapa sir and everyone who contributed.
-Thank you so much.
